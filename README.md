Project 1 Proposal

Project Description/ Outline:
Reviewing NASDAQ data for the Big 5 over the last 10 years, we want to find out which of the Big 5 are the best to invest in either short or long term and contrast their performance against the NASDAQ as a whole over the same time period.
Big 5 stocks:
Amazon ('AMZN')
Apple ('AAPL')
Google ('GOOGL')
Microsoft ('MSFT')
Facebook ('FB')

 Research Questions to Answer:
Which of the big 5 was the best investment over the last 10 years (largest net change positive)
Which of the big 5 was the worst investment over the last 10 years (largest net change negative)
Most consistent of the big 5 over the last 10 years (lowest daily percent change averaged over 10 year period)
Are there yearly events that contribute to stock volatility (identify recurring spikes and dips in stock prices throughout the year, major positive and negative changes)? Are these regularly recurring?
Based on the potentiality of recurring events, are there general good times to buy and sell the big 5 throughout the calendar year?
Did the big 5 outperform or underperform the NASDAQ composite as a whole over the 10 year period?
Of all the shares bought in the big 5, who had the most shares bought over the last 10 years?
What are the closing prices for the big 5 going to be on Aug 31st 2020 (LinReg)? How does the prediction compare to the actual prices they were this year?
